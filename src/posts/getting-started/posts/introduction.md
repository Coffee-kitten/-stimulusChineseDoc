Welcome to the first officially released template of Spruce CSS. It happens that it is a documentation template built on [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).

## About the Template

We created a documentation template because it is a relatively straightforward design.

It follows a simple structure with two levels. We think it is helpful for any OSS project documentation, but you can also use it for any notes.

## Spruce CSS

The template is built on [Spruce CSS](https://sprucecss.com/), a small and customizable CSS framework.
